Even though it was a practice assignment, I wasn't going to let this beat me. I decided to re-do the calculator with a different approach. My first take left a lot of ugly uneven black spaces surrounding the buttons and flex-wrap kept indenting a new line in the middle of the div instead of right below of the previous row. So this time, I decided to take the approach of dividing the buttons into separated containers (block rows). I realized the elements within these rows touched the top and the bottom of the container (no padding). This was a good realization because if I could stack these div rows, it would minimize the uneven ugly spacing from the top and bottom of the buttons. But oh no! Now theres uneven spaces on the side of the buttons -- "Browsers always add spaces between some elements, including buttons. To remove these, you need to set font-size to zero for their parent container.". Not only was that fixed but now I could change the font-size within the buttons and the buttons themselves won't change size as well. After that, it was easy. If you look at my HTML code, I have separated every row with a div and added a row of buttons. I could've done it with vertical columns but that would've presented new challenges when it came to the large buttons on the calculator. Plus, flex-wrap was doing most of the work for me.  My CSS is divided into ".row-"num"" and "btn", it should be self-explanatory. That was my approach to this design practice in HTML and CSS! Thanks for reading!
